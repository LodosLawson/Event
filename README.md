"The Event project is a unique program that allows you to interact with your Google Forms and forums with users. 
Whether you are a user or an admin, this program offers various functionalities such as searching for user forums, 
filling out and submitting forms within the program, 
creating Google Forms within the program and sharing them with users either at specified times or without any time restrictions. 
Additionally, you can scan the QR codes you send to users here to verify their validity."
